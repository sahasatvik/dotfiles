#
# Usage:
#
#   $ 720p AppName
#
# (where “AppName” is the name of the app to resize.)
#
# For example:
#
#  $ 720p Chrome
#
#  $ 720p Terminal
#
# Doesn't work with all apps, but does for iTerm2

if [[ $(uname -a | grep -ci Darwin) != 1 ]]; then
  echo "Sorry, this script only works on macOS"
  exit 1
fi

echo "Setting $1 bounds to 720p"

# 720p is 1280x720.
# Bounds is startX, startY, endX, endY. Adjust size from starting position to account for this
osascript -e "tell application \"$1\" to set the bounds of the first window to {250, 220, 1530, 940}"

# activate the app, to bring it to the front
osascript -e "tell application \"$1\" to activate"
