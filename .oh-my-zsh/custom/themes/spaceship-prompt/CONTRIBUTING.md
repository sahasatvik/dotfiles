# Contributing

First of all, thank you for contributing. Any contribution is highly appreciated and welcome.

## Philosophy

There's a simple philosophy behind the Spaceship:

* **Show only what's needed.** The prompt should not be overloaded, it shows only what user needs at the moment (current directory, git branch, etc).
* **Work out of the box.** The prompt should work right after installation without any additional configuration. Install it and use it.
* **Be configurable.** It works without configuration, but if a configuration is needed, it provides an easy-to-use interface for customization.

Please, keep this simple rules in mind while you're contributing to Spaceship.

## Setup

1. **Fork** this repo (click the _fork_ button)
2. **Clone** your fork to your working machine (via `git clone`)
3. **Add and commit** your contributions (we suggest you to check out a new branch for changes)
4. **Push** your changes to your remote fork
5. **Open a pull-request** to our primary repo

## Sections

Spaceship supports most of the popular programming languages, runtimes, version managers, etc. If it doesn't support something that you need, feel free to open a pull request, but answer these questions for yourself before:

### Will it clutter the prompt?

Having too much in prompt looks ugly. your much space or be shown too often.

* **Good:** `ðŸš€ v1.2.3`
* **Bad:** `ðŸš€ spasheship#c3BhY2VzaGlw`

### Is it worth to be aware of it?

Is value changes quite often so it needs to be shown in prompt? Would it be useful for other users? Maybe there's a reason to execute a command instead of cluttering prompt.

* **Good:** git status/branch, runtime version via version manager, etc
* **Bad:** version of language-specific framework, settled projects versions, etc

### Will it slow down the prompt?

Every additional section will slow down the prompt a little bit. If your section performs any heavy checkings, find a way to make it faster or consider using an alias instead of creating a new section.

* **Good:** check if command exists, check the value of environment variable
* **Bad:** network requests, reading large files, etc

### Documentation

When updating documentation for your section, make sure the markdown document is being properly rendered by Github. Specifically, the following common pitfalls have already been discovered:

* Empty inline code block `Â ` will only be rendered if you put at least one non-breaking whitespace "&nbsp;" inside, like so: `` `Â ` `` â†’ `Â `
* Leading and trailing whitespaces in inline code blocks will be stripped, to indicate that a whitespace is present, use the middot symbol `Â·`, like so: `` `ðŸš€Â·` `` â†’ `ðŸš€Â·`
