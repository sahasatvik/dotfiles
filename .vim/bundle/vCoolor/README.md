vCoolor - Simple color selector/picker for Vim (<small>v1.2.3</small>)
===========================================================================

Description
-----------

vCoolor is a Vim plugin that allows using a color picker/selector directly from the editor.

What this plugin do:

* Insert hex, rgb, rgba (With 1 in opacity) or hsl color anywhere.
* Modify hex color even if there are many colors in 1 line.
* Modify a rgb color with 0-255 values or % (Only one by line).
* Modify a rgba color but don't change the opacity (Only one by line).
* Modify a hsl color (Only one by line).

What this plugin doesn't do:

* Insert or modify hsla colors.

In GNU/Linux it uses a simple GTK+ dialog via [Zenity](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/Zenity) or [Yad](http://sourceforge.net/projects/yad-dialog/).

In windows it uses [colorpicker-windows-commandline](https://github.com/jaxbot/colorpicker-windows-commandline) (The binary is included in the plugin).

![vCoolor](.img/screen-win.png)

In Mac OSX it uses a [ruby script](https://github.com/KabbAmine/vCoolor.vim/tree/master/osx/color-picker) to trigger the system color picker.

And if you want, you can even [use your own color picker](#customPicker).

Installation
-------------

To use vCoolor in GNU/Linux, you need to have [Zenity](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/Zenity) (Included in most distributions) or [Yad](http://sourceforge.net/projects/yad-dialog/) (If you compile it manually, do it with GTK2 to avoid problem [#1](https://github.com/KabbAmine/vCoolor.vim/issues/1)).

### Manual installation

Install the distributed files into Vim runtime directory which is usually `~/.vim/`, or `$HOME/vimfiles` on Windows.

### Using Pathogen
If you're using pathogen, extract the files into `bundle` directory.

### Using a plugin manager

And this is the recommended way, use a vim plugin manager:

| Plugin manager                                         | In vimrc                         | Installation command |
|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| [Vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)       | `Plug 'KabbAmine/vCoolor.vim'`      | `PlugInstall`          |
| [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim)         | `Plugin 'KabbAmine/vCoolor.vim'`    | `PluginInstall`        |
| [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim)   | `NeoBundle 'KabbAmine/vCoolor.vim'` | `NeoBundleInstall`     |

Usage
-----

In both NORMAL and INSERT modes, only 1 shortcut is needed: `<Alt-C>` (I find it very convenient :smile:), but he may be not working on terminal.

Use it:

* To insert a color anywhere.
* To modify the current hex, rgb, rgba or hsl color.

And using:

* `<Alt-R>` you can insert a rgb color anywhere (NORMAL and INSERT modes).
* `<Alt-V>` you can insert a hsl color anywhere (NORMAL and INSERT modes).
* `<Alt-W>` you can insert a rgba color anywhere (NORMAL and INSERT modes).

Commands
--------

You can execute vCoolor with:

	:VCoolor
	:VCoolIns r		" For rgb color insertion
	:VCoolIns h		" For hsl color insertion
	:VCoolIns ra	" For rgba color insertion

You can toggle between lower/upper case for the returned hex color with:

	:VCase

Also, I've used some color conversion commands for debug purpose but I finally decided to keep them in the plugin, they may be useful.

Here they are with exemples to understand how they work:

	:Rgb2Hex "255, 0, 255"			" Gives "#FF00FF"
	:Rgb2RgbPerc "255, 0, 255"		" Gives "100%, 0%, 100%"
	:Rgb2Hsl "255, 0, 255"			" Gives "300, 100%, 50%"

	:RgbPerc2Hex "100%, 0%, 100%" " Gives "#FF00FF"
	:RgbPerc2Rgb "100%, 0%, 100%" " Gives "255, 0, 255"

	:Hex2Lit "#FF00FF"				" Gives "magenta"
	:Hex2Rgb "#FF00FF"				" Gives "255, 0, 255"
	:Hex2RgbPerc "#FF00FF"			" Gives "100%, 0%, 100%"
	:Hex2Hsl "#FF00FF"				" Gives "300, 100%, 50%"

	:Hsl2Rgb "300, 100%, 50%"		" Gives "255, 0, 255"
	:Hsl2Hex "300, 100%, 50%"		" Gives "#FF00FF"

Mapping
-------

To change the mapping by default, add to your vimrc.

	let g:vcoolor_map = '<NEW_MAPPING>'
	let g:vcool_ins_rgb_map = '<NEW_MAPPING>'		" Insert rgb color.
	let g:vcool_ins_hsl_map = '<NEW_MAPPING>'		" Insert hsl color.
	let g:vcool_ins_rgba_map = '<NEW_MAPPING>'		" Insert rgba color.

Each mapping works in both `NORMAL` and `INSERT` mode ([You can disable all of them](#disableMaps) if you want).

Customization
-------------

### Hex colors in lowercase

To get hex colors in lower case by default, add to your vimrc:

	let g:vcoolor_lowercase = 1

### Disable default mappings<a id="disableMaps"></a>

To disable all default mappings and map only what you want:

	let g:vcoolor_disable_mappings = 1

### Define a custom color picker<a id="customPicker"></a>

Any color picker who take/return a hexcolor in standard I/O can be defined as the one used in the plugin:

	let g:vcoolor_custom_picker = 'path/to/picker --option '

As an example with zenity in GNU/Linux:

	let g:vcoolor_custom_picker = 'zenity --title "custom" --color-selection --show-palette --color '

Please note that the hex color will be added in the end of the string above, so add a space if needed.

Example of configuration
------------------------

```
let g:vcoolor_lowercase = 1
let g:vcoolor_disable_mappings = 1
let g:vcoolor_map = '<leader>g'
```

TODO
----

- [ ] A better regex patterns.
- [x] Handle rgba colors.
- [ ] Handle hsla colors.
- [ ] Add possibility to modify 2 or more rgb colors in a line.
- [ ] Option to abbreviate colors.
